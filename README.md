## Overview
Don't Pay Trump is a Chrome extension that makes it easier to shop
ethically. We were inspired by the [Grab Your
Wallet](https://grabyourwallet.org/) campaign and make use of the list
they built out. The goals are to make it simple and easy to boycott
companies that support Trump by selling his family's products.

## Goals
While boycotting these companies is the main goal of the campaign, the
overall goals of the extension itself are the following:

- Easily configurable per user preferences
- The experience should be unintrusive as a browsing experience
- Accessible to differently abled people
- Lightweight on the users device resource usage
